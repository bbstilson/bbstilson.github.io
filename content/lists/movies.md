# 2024

- Training Day (2001)
  - Great movie. Tense AF. Denzel and Hawke are amazing.
- Rush (2013)
  - Pretty good biopic about F1 drivers in the 70s.
- Palm Springs (2020)
  - Hilarious Groundhog Day style time loop movie.
- Predestination (2014)
  - Really solid time travel movie.
- Constantine (2001)
  - Really holds up. A+ comic book movie
- Monkey Man (2024)
  - Great action film. Super gory and sexual. The Indian John Wick.
- Oppenheimer (2024)
  - Solid biopic. Only a couple standout scenes but fantastic acting throughout. Worth watching if you have 3 hours to kill.
- The Fall (2006)
  - Lee Pace is great. Beautifully shot on location in over 20 countries. Go see it.
- Emily the Criminal (2022)
  - I believe Aubrey would do this in real life if it weren't for acting.
- Edge of Tomorrow (2014)
  - Okay for a hollywood blockbuster action movie, but pretty meh as far as time travel movies go.
- Godzilla Minus One (2023)
  - Pretty fun. It's a big lizard.
- TAU (2018)
  - Fun sci-fi movie about AI.
- The Titan (2018)
  - Okay sci-fi movie about genetic transformation to withstand spacetravel / other planets.
- Time Trap (2017)
  - Solid B sci-fi movie loosely about time travel.
- Ready Player One (2018)
  - YAWN. Definitely one of the CGI movies of all time.
- Blazing Saddles (1974)
  - When people say you can't make this movie in 2024, they're not wrong, but mostly because the story telling expectations have changed. Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little are hilarious. Mel Brooks doing red face speaking Yiddish is not something I expected.
- The Blues Brothers (1980)
  - A classic. Very goofy.
- They Cloned Tyrone (2023)
  - Solid sci-fi with a great cast and fun plot.
- The Imitation Game (2014)
  - Passable hollywood dramatized biopic.
- Spaceman (2024)
  - I really liked this even though it was depressing af. Sandler was great.
