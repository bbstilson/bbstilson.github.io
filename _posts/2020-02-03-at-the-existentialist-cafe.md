excerpt: Sir, What a Horror, Existentialism!
---

The author does a great job blending history, biography, and stances of important existentialist philosophers and practitioners into a seamless story. The book was useful in giving the reader an overview of a long-running school of thought. From proto-existentialists like Kierkegaard and Heidegger, to the famous French existentialists Sartre, de Beauvoir, and Camus, At the Existentialist Café gave just enough pages to the philosophy to whet the appetite without being overly dense, while also allowing the reader to derive a self-study guide to existentialist thought.

Some books to read next:

- Fear and Trembling by Kierkegaard
- The Second Sex by de Beauvoir
- Nausea by Sartre
